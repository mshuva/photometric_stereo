# Real-time Photometric Stereo with Computer Screen Lighting

## University of Michigan, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

This is a project I did for Professor Laura Balzano. The project was inspired by a [paper](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~phlosoft/files/schindler08_3dpvt.pdf) published the Georgia Institue of Technology that perform real-time photometric stereo using a computer screen as it's lighting source.
